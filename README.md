# MOODSIC
## Milestone Project by Art Balenok
### Moodsic - music for your mood at the moment

**External userâ€™s goal:**
Find music albums on Spotify that match their current mood.

**Site owner's goal:**
Earn money on each album purchased via a link from the site.

**The features include:**
1. Users select their current mood from a dropdown menu. The selection will open in a new page, and user will be able to select the album(s) from the displayed results.
2. The application allows users to upload details of the album(s) not currently present in the database, along with the relevant artwork and link to Spotify.
3. The application allows users to write comments about any album and upvote it.
4. The above will be achieved by creating the backend code and frontend form(s) to allow users to add new books and reviews to the site, edit them and delete them.
5. Only correct links to Spotify will be accepted.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate the skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python+Flask, MongoDB, as well as additional libraries and external APIs that I (probably) have learned with Code Institute thus far.
